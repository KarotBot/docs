# Setting the prefix

## Permissions

Before changing the prefix, ensure you have the `MANAGE_SERVER`or `ADMINISTRATOR`permission.  
If you have correct permissions, just use the command below!  
  
\[d\] = The default/current prefix of the bot, this is `+` by default. \(Not actually "\[d\]"\)  
\[p\] = Your new prefix, not "\[p\]"!

```javascript
[d]prefix [p]
```

#### That's it!

You have successfully set Karot's prefix, so proud of you! ðŸ˜ƒ
