# Soundboard

\[p\] = Your prefix, not "\[p\]"! This is `+` by default.  
\[s\] = The selected sfx \(sound effect\)

{% hint style="danger" %}
This feature is still being tested, if you have any ideas, feedback or any other concerns using the command, make sure to create a ticket in [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/uBAPdmP9bE)!
{% endhint %}

## Playing a sound

Playing a sound is easy once you learn how to do it!

```text
[p]soundboard play [s]
```

You can get a full list of sounds `[s]` you can play by using the command without any arguments \(with no sound specified\)

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use the alias `sb` instead of `soundboard` to play stuff quicker! 
{% endhint %}
